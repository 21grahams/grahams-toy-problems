/* leetcode - Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children */

const minDepth = root => {
  // do something
};

console.log(minDepth([3,9,20,null,null,15,7]]) // 2
console.log(minDepth([2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]]) // 5
