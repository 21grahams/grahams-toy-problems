/* Transpose

/* You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.

e.g. transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);

should return:
H W  
e o  
l r  
l l  
o d
*/

// input: an array of two strings
// output: those same strings, but displayed from top to bottom, rather than left to right
// constraints: none at this time
// edge cases: none at this time
const transposeTwoStrings = arr => {
  // create first, second and longest word variables
  // check which is longest word
  // create transposed string
  // loop over longest word
    // assign first character to first word at i, second character to second word at i
    // increment transposed string to first word, second word and newline symbol

  // return transposed string
