// leetcode - Merge Sorted Arrays

/*
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has a size equal to m + n such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from nums2.
*/

const merge = (nums1, m, nums2, n) => {
  // do something
};


console.log(merge([1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], 3, [2, 5, 6], 3));

console.log(merge([1], 1, [], 0));
