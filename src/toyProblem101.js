/* There are two sets of traditional six-faced dice, represented by two arrays A and B consisting of N and M integers respectively. Each array element has a value between 1 and 6, inclusive, representing the value of the corresponding die

Write a function that given two arrays A and B, returns the minimum number of dice to be turned in order to make the sums of dice in both sets equal, or -1 if that is not possible */
